# Structure

most likely we start at 4:10 minutes

we should make it as collaborative as possible - thinking we can try out the flok.cc collaborative thingy?? I have so many ideas on how to bring more collaboration and socialization 
amongst the attendees. 

way to bring more collaboration: 
  -  first things first everyone has to go sit next to someone they don't know
  - everyone has to sit as close as possible (avoiding them sitting in the back)
