# Structure

most likely we start at 4:10 minutes

we should make it as collaborative as possible - thinking we can try out the flok.cc collaborative thingy?? I have so many ideas on how to bring more collaboration and socialization 
amongst the attendees. 

way to bring more collaboration: 
  -  first things first everyone has to go sit next to someone they don't know
  - everyone has to sit as close as possible (avoiding them sitting in the back)
  - for us teaching - we stop more to ask if anyone has any questions 




# Activity - Hydra (20 minutes??)
1. Have them test out each source to see the differences and what they like 
2. have them add some geometry or modulate (can pick)
3. Have them test out the Init functions (screen and Cam) to then mess around with input and what they can do. 
  - image and video (from youtube) - need to teach them controls tho and the difference between running all code vs just a line as this is vital for 
  -  can have them pixelate
  - can have them try modulateScroll
  - mess around with color (really fun and the functions should not be too tolling) 
4. implement hydra w/strudel
