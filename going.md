Only two people showed up but I guess that was our fault for doing a workshop on a march day (was not planned whatsoever we were glad everyone was at the march and we would have been too)
It was really fun and laxed partially because they did not know how to code

SO MANY PEOPLE CAME??? it was a bit awkward because no one was saying much and was super quiet but carol did faboulous while I was a stuttering mess. I felt like they were all strung out by the time 
I got to the podium because strudel is a lot to take in. I got all nervous for a sudden also because the projector was stressing me out so bad because I felt a bit out of control while being well in control? 
I also got carol up to explain hydra in strudel because I felt like they didnt want to listen to me! Which I should have not done ://

notes on logistic - 
  - make github public before the workshop so that code is accessible especially if we are not using our laptops where we are logged in
  - DO not show examples just start doing demoes as examples
  - make music accessible in a youtube playlist (have a spotify playlist rn but would have to log in so no)
  - have more audioreactive examples
  - have people introduce themselves and give a bit background around them so ppl can make friends + we know their coding level
  - zoom in on the strudel/hydra screen so people can see it
  - walk around during independent work time and check on people individually
